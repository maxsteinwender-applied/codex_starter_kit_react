# Stack Rules

## Purpose
This folder defines the active coding stack profile and stack selection rules for new projects.

## What Is Here
- `STACKS.md` as the central stack selection and governance file.
- `react.md` with the active stack profile and default libraries.

## When To Use
Use this folder when `project_track: coding` is active and React stack conventions are needed.

## Scope Boundary
Do not place feature implementation details or UX/copy content in this folder.

## Maintenance
Add new tools only when explicitly needed, and keep all related path references synchronized.
