# Frontend Rules (Codex)

1. Use React UI defaults (`shadcn/ui`).
2. Implement loading, empty, error, and success states.
3. Ensure responsive behavior for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
4. Apply semantic HTML and accessibility basics (labels, focus, keyboard paths).
5. Keep components small and composable.
6. Use React stack motion and chart libraries by default.
7. Avoid introducing new frontend libraries without `/prod` approval.
8. Start with documented core UI patterns; use advanced primitives only when feature needs justify complexity.
